This test problem is from Vilhelmsen et al. (2012) and is included as the test problem in Langevin et al. (2014).  

The problem consists of two models: a structured grid parent model and a structured grid child model.  The parent model has 9 layers, 61 rows,a nd 49 columns.  The child model has 25 layers, which penetrate the entire parent model, 90 rows and 78 columns.
