Simple steady state model using a regular MODFLOW grid to simulate the response of an anisotropic confined aquifer to a pumping well. For this problem, the XT3D formulation is used so that hydraulic conductivity ellipse can be rotated in the x-y plane.  A constant-head boundary condition surrounds the active domain.  K22 is set to 0.01, which causes hydraulic conductivity in the column direction (prior to rotation) to be 100 x less than K in the row direction.  This ellipse is then rotated in the x-y plane by specifying a value for ANGLE1 in the NPF Package.  ANGLE1 is specifed with a constant value of 15 degrees for the entire grid, which means the dominant K component is rotated 15 degrees counter clockwise.  Drawdown is more pronounced along the dominant axis of the hydraulic conductivity ellipse.
