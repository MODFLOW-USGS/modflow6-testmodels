This is a modified version of the unsaturated zone-stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test simulation 2) from the Unsaturated Zone Flow Package documentation (Niswonger and others, 2006).  Originally, this problem is simulated using the Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF) and Streamflow Routing (SFR) Packages in MODFLOW 6. The drain (DRN) package has been added to simulate groundwater discharge to the surface that was originally simulated using the UZF SIMULATE_GWSEEP option with a SURFDEP of 1.0 in all UZF cells. Drains were specified in every cell containing a UZF cell and have a elevation 0.5 feet below land surface, a conductance of 25. square feet per day (a value equal to the conductance calculated by the UZF package when the SIMULATE_GWSEEP option is specified), and a drainage depth of 1.0 foot.  The top of the model has been modified to be equal to the top elevation of all SFR reaches, in cells containing SFR reaches, in order to simulate water-levels that exceed land surface and drain discharge from the model. The Mover (MVR) Package is used to move water from the DRN and UZF Packages to the SFR Package. The Newton-Raphson formulation was specified to allow a direct comparison to a model with the UZF package SIMULATE_GWSEEP option and no drains.
